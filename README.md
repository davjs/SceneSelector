### What
A dropdown next to the unity play button for switching scenes. Automaticly populated by scenes found in the project.

### Why
Having to browse for scenes in the same window that is meant for code and prefabs can get cumbersome.
Scenes are also the primary context in the Unity Editor, making it intuitive to have them readily availible at the top, with changes cascading down upon swapping scenes.

### Package root folder
The "Package" root folder is: [Assets/SceneSelector](https://github.com/davjs/SceneSelector/tree/main/Assets/SceneSelector)
